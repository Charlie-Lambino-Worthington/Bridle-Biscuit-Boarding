# Bridles & Biscuits Boarding

Bridle & Biscuit Boarding is a booking system for a short stay stables designed for people travelling without their equine companions. This  project is a Full Stack website built using Django. This stable booking website is built to allow users to book a stable online and leave reviews of their experience using our services. Users are required to register in order to book or leave a review. 

### MVP

The MVP for this project includes user registration, booking creation, and deletion to provide users with a easy to use booking system to book their mounts into Bridles and Biscuits Boarding. It also includes a review form with review creation, editing and deletion, so customers can leave reviews for future customers, to enable people to make an informed decision.

### Problem Statement

Problem statement: Owning your own horse or donkey is great but when you want to go on holiday, where can you get someone to take care of your horse. Many stables only do long term boarding and can you really trust someone coming in to check on them once or twice a day?

Purpose: Our site allows you to book your horse or donkey into a professionally run stables with highly qualified equine professionals for short stays, so that you can holiday in peace knowing your mount is fully cared for, supervised and safe.

Target audience: Horse or Donkey owners who normally keep their Horses and Donkeys in their own stable yards, when they want to or need to travel and are unable to take their Horses or Donkeys with them.
