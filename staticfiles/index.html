                <br>
                <p>
                    Anastasia White, owner of Bridle and Biscuit Boarding, is a former competitive eventer. She embarked on a journey driven by her profound passion for horses and a deep-seated concern for their well-being. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Recognizing the common anxiety experienced by horse owners who must leave their beloved companions in the care of others, especially those who may not offer the level of attention they desire, she took a bold step towards creating a unique solution. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Her own experiences with the stress of traveling without her horse, coupled with the dissatisfaction she felt at the prospect of entrusting her horse's care to someone who could only perform cursory checks daily, motivated her to establish a stable that functions more like a hotel for horses. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    At Bridle and Biscuit Boarding, every horse is treated with the individualized care and attention they deserve, offering peace of mind to their owners through personalized boarding services that prioritize comfort, safety, and care. This innovative approach not only addresses the needs of traveling horse owners but also reflects the owner's dedication to enhancing the lives of horses and their human companions alike.
